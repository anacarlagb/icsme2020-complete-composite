		<p class="text-justify"> Code refactoring is a common practice in software maintenance. 
		A single refactoring is a code transformation that aims to improve the internal software quality. 
		Recent studies have revealed that developers often apply composite refactorings (or, simply, composites).
		 A composite consists of two or more interrelated transformations (refactorings) applied together.
		  Previous studies characterized composites and investigated whether and how they remove poor structures 
		  -- i.e., code smells. A composite refactoring is considered ``complete'' whenever it completely removes 
		  one target code smell. They proposed descriptions of complete composites with recommendations to remove 
		  certain code smell types, such as Long Methods and Feature Envies. These studies also present 
		  different recommendations to remove the same code smell type. However, these studies: (i) are limited to 
		  composite refactorings only consisting of a small subset of Fowler's refactoring types, (ii) did not detail
		   the scenarios in which each recommendation can be applied to remove the code smell, and (iii) fail in 
		   reporting possible side effects of the described composites, such as adversely introducing certain smell types. 
		   This paper aims to cover these limitations by performing a systematic analysis of 618 complete 
		   composites on removing four common smell types identified in 20 software projects. Our results 
		   indicated that: (i) 64% complete composites consisted of refactoring types not covered by existing 
		   descriptions of complete composites, and (ii) 36% complete composites formed by Extract Methods 
		   can introduce Feature Envies and Intensive Couplings. This information is not documented 
		   by existing descriptions, and it can alert developers about alternatives to remove Feature Envy, 
		   mainly in methods that are fully envious. These results suggest existing descriptions of complete composites 
		   should be either revisited or enhanced to explicitly highlight known side effects. As the main contribution, 
		   we present a catalog of composites with details about side effects, recommendations to remove or minimize them, 
		   and some scenarios in which each recommendation can be applied to remove the code smell. Also, we provide real 
		   examples in which this catalog was applied in practice. Our catalog can be useful to improve existing tooling
		   support for refactorings, such as IDEs, informing about possible side effects when refactorings are composed. </p>
