		<p class="text-justify">Code refactoring is a common practice in software maintenance. A single refactoring is a code transformation that aims to improve the internal software quality. 
		Recent studies have revealed that developers often apply composite refactorings (or,simply, composites). A composite consists of two or more interrelated transformations (refactorings) applied together. Previous studies characterized composites and investigated whether and how they remove poor structures – i.e., code smells. A composite refactoring is considered "complete" whenever it completely removes one target code smell.
		They proposed descriptions of complete composites with recommendations to remove certaincode smell types, such as Long Methods and Feature Envies. These studies also present different recommendations to remove the same code smell type. 
		However, these studies: (i) are limitedto composite refactorings only consisting of a small subset of Fowler’s refactoring types, (ii) did not detail the scenarios in which each recommendation can be applied to remove the code smell, and (iii) fail in reporting possible side effects of the described composites, such as adversely introducing certain smell types.
		This paper aims to cover these limitations by performinga systematic analysis of 618 complete composites on removing four common smell types identified in 20 software projects.
		Our results indicated that: (i) 64% complete composites consisted ofrefactoring types not covered by existing descriptions of complete composites, and (ii) 36% complete composites formed by at least one Extract Method can introduce Feature Envies and Intensive Couplings. This information is not documented by existingdescriptions, and it can alert developers about alternatives toremoveFeature Envy, mainly in methods that are fully envious.These results suggest existing descriptions of complete compositesshould be either revisited or enhanced to explicitly highlightknown side effects. As the main contribution, we present a catalogof composites with details about side effects, recommendation to remove or minimize them, and some scenarios in which each recommendation can be applied to remove the code smell. Also, we provide a real examples in which this catalog was applied inpractice. Our catalog can be useful to improve existing toolingsupport for refactorings, such as IDEs, informing about possibleside effects when refactorings are composed.</p>
